# Hi.
I'm April.
I help people design solutions that create positive change for other people.

I’m a hands-on leader who loves to work directly with customers (people) and product teams (also people) to develop new ideas and products that make life better.  My best work is taking strategies and making them real, by working together to create a larger vision and make that vision real.  

We all need a more just, sustainable world. If you're working towards that world, I'd like to work with you!

I just really like people, but my other skills include
* Leading product innovation, operations and management 
* Supporting and advocating for human-centered design
* Strategy development and hands-on organizational change 
* Teaching others through team and leadership coaching 

I'm constantly learning, and I'm currently working on:
* What's next for accessibility and inclusivity
* ESG and sustainable management
* Responsible tech in an increasingly AI and data-led world
